# Listing

Type: `keepass-listing`

The listing provisioner is used to generate a listing of all values and
attachments of entries within a KeePass 2 database and the map keys by which
to access them.

### Required

- `keepass_file` (string) - Path to the KeePass 2 database.
- `keepass_password` (string) - Master password for the KeePass 2 database.

### Example Usage

The KeePass master password can be passed in as either a command line argument or as a packer environment variable.

```
$ packer build -var="keepass_password=password" example/provisioner-listing.pkr.hcl
```

```
$ export PKR_VAR_keepass_password=password
$ packer build example/provisioner-listing.pkr.hcl
```

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    keepass = {
      version = ">= 0.3.1"
      source  = "github.com/chunqi/keepass"
    }
  }
}

variable "keepass_password" {
  type = string
  sensitive = true
}

source "null" "example" {
  communicator = "none"
}

build {
  sources = ["sources.null.example"]

  provisioner "keepass-listing" {
      keepass_file="example/example.kdbx"
      keepass_password="${var.keepass_password}"
  }
}
```
