# Attachment

Type: `keepass-attachment`

The attachment provisioner is used to upload file attachments contained within
entries of a KeePass 2 database.

### Required

- `keepass_file` (string) - Path to the KeePass 2 database.
- `keepass_password` (string) - Master password for the KeePass 2 database.
- `attachment_path` (string) - Attachment to be uploaded. Use the listing provisioner to see all file paths.
- `destination` (string) - Destination path to upload the attachment.

#### Notes

- `attachment_path` - The entry root path can be used to mean upload all file attachments for the entry.
- `destination`
  - If the `attachment_path` is a file attachment, its name will be automatically appended if the `destination` is a directory, otherwise `destination` is treated as a literal file path.
  - If the `attachment_path` is an entry root path, the destination directory will be created.

### Example Usage

The KeePass master password can be passed in as either a command line argument or as a packer environment variable.

```
$ packer build -var="keepass_password=password" example/provisioner-attachment.pkr.hcl
```

```
$ export PKR_VAR_keepass_password=password
$ packer build example/provisioner-attachment.pkr.hcl
```

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    keepass = {
      version = ">= 0.3.1"
      source  = "github.com/chunqi/keepass"
    }
  }
  required_plugins {
    docker = {
      version = ">= 0.0.7"
      source = "github.com/hashicorp/docker"
    }
  }
}

variable "keepass_password" {
  type = string
  sensitive = true
}

source "docker" "alpine" {
  image  = "alpine:3.15"
  commit = true
}

build {
  name    = "alpine"
  sources = [
    "source.docker.alpine"
  ]
  provisioner "keepass-attachment" {
    keepass_file = "example/example.kdbx"
    keepass_password = "${var.keepass_password}"
    attachment_path = "/example/Sample Entry-test.txt"
    destination = "/tmp/attachment.txt"
  }
  provisioner "keepass-attachment" {
    keepass_file = "example/example.kdbx"
    keepass_password = "${var.keepass_password}"
    attachment_path = "/example/Sample Entry"
    destination = "/tmp/"
  }
}
```
