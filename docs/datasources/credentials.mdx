# Credentials

Type: `keepass-credentials`

The credentials data source is used to insert the values of credentials within
a KeePass 2 database.

### Required

- `keepass_file` (string) - Path to the KeePass 2 database.
- `keepass_password` (string) - Master password for the KeePass 2 database.

### OutPut

- `map` (map[string]string) - A map of entry values keyed by path and UUID. 

The following map keys are constructed for each entry within the KeePass
database:

* `<path-to-entry>/<title>-<key>`
* `<uuid>-<key>`

The `<path-to-entry>` is the names of the group (folder) names combined with the
`/` symbol and `<title>` is the title of the entry.

The plugin will warn of ambiguous paths present in the KeePass database in the
packer log. Note that only the first instance of any path will be accessible.

To find the `<uuid>` of each credential entry, in KeePass go to **View** ->
**Configure Columns...** and check the **UUID** column to be displayed.

![KeePass displaying UUID](/docs/datasources/keepass-uuid.png)

The `<key>` is the internal name of the data value which corresponds to the
credential entry. The common keys, visible in the GUI, are as follows  (note the
exact spelling):

- `Title`
- `UserName`
- `Password`
- `URL`
- `Notes` (key will not exist if blank)

Additional custom data added via **Advanced** -> **String fields** can also be
accessed by using the data name as the `key`.

The example KeePass 2 database (`example/example.kdbx`) with sample entries will
thus generate the following keys and values:

```
/example/Sample Entry-Notes: Notes
/example/Sample Entry-Password: Password
/example/Sample Entry-Title: Sample Entry
/example/Sample Entry-URL: https://keepass.info/
/example/Sample Entry-UserName: User Name
F9E8062C3814F943BCBCB6FE81FAAA2F-Notes: Notes
F9E8062C3814F943BCBCB6FE81FAAA2F-Password: Password
F9E8062C3814F943BCBCB6FE81FAAA2F-Title: Sample Entry
F9E8062C3814F943BCBCB6FE81FAAA2F-URL: https://keepass.info/
F9E8062C3814F943BCBCB6FE81FAAA2F-UserName: User Name
/example/Sample Entry #2-Password: 12345
/example/Sample Entry #2-Title: Sample Entry #2
/example/Sample Entry #2-URL: https://keepass.info/
/example/Sample Entry #2-UserName: Michael321
F1ABA233DAE73E419937F475C593F31C-Password: 12345
F1ABA233DAE73E419937F475C593F31C-Title: Sample Entry #2
F1ABA233DAE73E419937F475C593F31C-URL: https://keepass.info/
F1ABA233DAE73E419937F475C593F31C-UserName: Michael321
```

Building `example/data-var.pkr.hcl` will generate the following output in
`credentials.txt`:

```
Michael321:12345
```

### Example Usage

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    keepass = {
      version = ">= 0.3.0"
      source  = "github.com/chunqi/keepass"
    }
  }
}

variable "keepass_password" {
  type = string
  sensitive = true
}

data "keepass-credentials" "example" {
  keepass_file = "example/example.kdbx"
  keepass_password = "${var.keepass_password}"
}

source "file" "example" {
  content = format("%s:%s",
    data.keepass-credentials.example.map["F1ABA233DAE73E419937F475C593F31C-UserName"],
    data.keepass-credentials.example.map["/example/Sample Entry #2-Password"]
  )
  target = "credentials.txt"
}

build {
  sources = ["sources.file.example"]
}
```
